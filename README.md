This is the download repository for the QCxMS program. 

**Installation**

### Binary 

Statically linked binaries (Intel Compiler 21.3.0) can be found at the [latest release page](https://github.com/qcxms/QCxMS/releases/latest).

Untar the zipped archive:

```bash
tar -xvzf QCxMS.vX.X.tar.xz
```

The following files are being extracted: `qcxms` `pqcxms` `q-batch` `getres` `.XTBPARAM` `EXAMPLE`

Place the executables into your ``$HOME/bin/`` directory or path. Place the `.XTBPARAM` folder and `.mass_raw.arg` file into your `$HOME` directory (these files can appear to be hidden). 

### Spectra Plotting
To evaluate the results and create a spectrum, download and use the [PlotMS](https://github.com/qcxms/PlotMS) program. For visualization of the calculated spectra, we recommend the usage of the **xmgrace** program. Furthermore, *JCAMP-DX* and *.csv* are plotted. Versions PlotMS v.6.0 and higher now provide **exact masses**. The `.mass_raw.agr` file was moved to the [PlotMS](https://github.com/qcxms/PlotMS) repository. 

### Meson

Using [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) as build system requires you to install a fairly new version like 0.57.2 or newer.
To use the default backend of meson you have to install [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) version 1.10 or newer.

```bash
export FC=ifort CC=icc
meson setup build -Dfortran_link_args=-static
ninja -C build 
```
Copy the binary from the `build/qcxms` file into a directory in your path, e.g. `~/bin/`.

**Documentation**

A more detailed documentation on topics like installation and input settings can be fond at [read-the-docs](https://xtb-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/qcxms_doc/qcxms.html). Examples to test QCxMS can be found in the `EXAMPLES` folder. Here, input and coordinate files are provided for either EI or CID run modes. 



**From QCEIMS to QCxMS:**
- All names have been changed from `qceims.xxx` to `qcxms.xxx`.
- The `q-batch`, `pqcxms` and `plotms` script have been updated.
- Collision induced dissociation (CID) calculations are now available. Set *cid* in the `qcxms.in` file. 

**The tblite library for xTB calculations**
- The [tblite](https://github.com/awvwgk/tblite) library has been included into the program code. This keeps xtb up-to-date and decreases the computational time for calculations done with GFN1- and GFN2-xTB when compared to earlier versions.
